    <p>
    The WEB services client library is used to ease the development of client softwares for the gPM remote service API.
    
    <p>
    Basically, an instance of the class {@link org.topcased.gpm.ws.v2.client.WebServicesStub} can be created
    in the client code. This stub instance is then used to call the remote WEB services available on the gPM server.
